                <p>
                    The days of cluttered, multi-paged websites are going in the same direction as parachute pants and floppy
                    disks: extinct.  There is a massive push by users to experience clean websites that do not overwhelm them
                    with tacky colors, flashing banners and annoying popups. As the population experiences more and more saturation with advertisements,
                    it is becoming increasingly important to grab the customer’s attention upon the first click to your website.
                    The way Medusa approaches this changing digital environment is by building large images near the top of the page,
                    which help to visually display what the business is about at first glance; this aids with both brand
                    recognition and helps you stand out from competitors. We also utilize techniques that help direct the
                    users’ sight through the use of smooth animations and photo galleries. It is important to balance the
                    website visually by mixing use of the content and image to ensure that one does not overshadow the other.
                    Many of our designs use section headers that are accompanied by visual queues, such as word art, to help
                    the user quickly find the information they are wanting.  At Medusa Design Co., we aim to ensure that the content of
                    your website is displayed in a neat and orderly fashion, making it both appealing and easy to gather
                    needed information for the customer.

                    <p>
                        Usability testing is a critical step in the web design process. The main disciplines that Medusa aims
                        to test are learnability and efficiency. Learnability is how easy it is for a new user to accomplish
                        tasks the first time they visit your site. Efficiency is how quickly users can complete tasks on your
                        site after they familiarize themselves with its use. The reason these two user interactions (UI) are
                        so important is because people will go to the next site if the first site they visit is not usable or
                        cannot be quickly be understood. Your business can have the most beautiful website in the world, but
                        people will leave immediately if they are unable to figure out how to navigate your site quickly. We
                        focuses on providing designs that are able to adapt the view of the website to the screen size of the
                        user’s device to aid in the website’s ease of use across devices.

                <p>
                    The first and arguably the most important step in beginning the web development process is picking one of our amazing designs.
                    All of our templates are built using a mobile-friendly framework developed by Twitter called Bootstrap. With this framework, your website will change and adapt
                    to the various device screen sizes that it may be viewed on, making a beautiful, fluid experience for your website visitors.
                </p>


                <p>
                    Our website templates are categorized by business type and are tailored to display your content in a clean and enticing manner. The payment for your site will be processed through a private, secure trusted site called Shopify.

                <h4><i class=\"fa fa-arrow-right\"></i> Step Two - Complete the DC Form</h4>

                <p>
                    Let’s get to know your business! Once you purchase one of our designs, you will be automatically sent an
                    email (to the address you provide), which contains a private link to the Design Customization Form. This
                    form is a great way for us to initially start the development process for your project.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Most of the questions focus on either visual design or written content for the website. We ask that you dedicate at least a 30 minutes
                    to completing this form to ensure that the questions are thoroughly answered.  If, for whatever reason, you
                    cannot answer a particular question, we will follow up with you to consult on this information at a later date.

                <p>
                    Once the Design Customization Form is complete and has been successfully submitted, we will send you an email confirming
                    that we have received your form. You should receive your confirmation email within 24-48 hours of submitting your form.
                    If you have not received your confirmation within that time window, please call us at 541-788-7601.
                </p>


                <p>
                    After we have had a chance to analyze the materials submitted, one of our developers will contact you by phone and discuss the overall website
                    design in order to make sure we are all on the same page. We like to contact customers by phone because it helps us establish
                    a more organic working relationship with our customers.

                <p>
                    Our timeline from point at which you select and purchase your design to completion and hosting your website live is typically
                    2-3 business days. Every project is different and presents its own set of challenges; therefore, this timeline can change depending
                    on your specific requests and circumstances. Often, when a website is hosted with big brand name hosting companies, the website is
                    actually sharing a computer with several other websites. This equates to a much slower loading speed and a disappointing browsing
                    experience for your customers, potentially costing you sales.

                <p>
                    At Medusa Design Co., we spin up a dedicated computer for each
                    client’s website.  This means your company won’t be fighting for bandwidth with other sites and will be much more responsive
                    to user engagement. All of the servers are maintained by Medusa Design Co. and kept in an ultra-secure multi-redundant
                    facility that practices the most up to date strategies in cyber-security.
